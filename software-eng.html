<h1><b>Chapter 7: Software Engineering </b></h1>

<b>Software engineering - </b> a systematic engineering approach to software development
<p> <b>integrated development environment (IDE) -</b> systems that combine tools for developing software into a single integrated package 
<br>
<h2>Association for Computting Machinery(ACM)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>purpose of ACM - </b>dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ehtical standards </li>
	<li><b>benefits of ACM membership -</b> provides tools and resources to advance your career and enrich your knowledge with life-long learning experiences</li>
	<li><b>student ACM membership - </b>helps students gain exposure to a wid range of skills and perspectivs that they won't find in the classroom</li>
</ul>

<br>
	
<h2>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>purpose of IEEE -</b> to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity</li>
	<li><b>benefits of IEEE membership - </b>access to new resources, valuable opportunities, and many discounts that help advance your career </li>
	<li><b>student IEEE membership - </b>are able to work with professionals, are made aware of scholarships, research programs, internships, employment opportunities, and career advancement programs </li>
</ul>

<h2> <b>Software Life Cycle: Development phase </b></h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Requirements analysis - </b>focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet the new or altered product or project</li>
	<li><b>Design - </b>process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems </li>
	<li><b>Implementation -</b> process of integrating an application into an organization's workflow</li>
	<li><b>Testing - </b>process of analyzing to examining a software product or system to determing whether or not it satisfies established conditions</li> 
</ul>
<br>

<b>Modular Implementation - </b>the implementation of interoperable systems or devices that can allow for easy adaptation throughout a specific industry or use case
<p><b>Unified Modeling Language (UML) - </b>a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system 
<p><b>Use Case -</b> a specific situation in which a product or service could potentially be used
<p><b>Use Case Diagram -</b> a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system 


<br>
<h2><b>Data relationships:</b></h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>one-to-one - </b>a relationship where a record in one table is associated with exactly one record in another table</li>
	<li><b>one-to-many - </b>a relationship where one row in a table can be associated with many rows in another table </li>
	<li><b>many-to-many -</b> a relationship where more than one record in a table is related to more than one record in another table </li>
</ul>
<br>
	
<b>Design Pattern - </b>a repeatable solution to a software engineering problem
<p><b>Software quality assurance (SQA) - </b>the ongoing process that ensures the software product meets and complies with the organization's estalished and standardized quality specifications

<h2>Software testing:</h2>
	<li><b>glass box testing -</b>
	a type of software testing methodology wherein testers can't create tests cases until the code of the program is written completely</li>
	<li><b>black box testing -</b>
	method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings</li>
	<li><b>beta testing - </b>
	a type of user acceptances testing where the product team gives a nearly finished product to a group of target users to evaluate product performance in the real world</li>
	<li><b>alpha testing -</b>
	a type of acceptance testing where in-house team of developers, designers, and quality assurance staff test a product for all possible flaws in a controlled lab environment</li>
	
<h2>Documentation:</h2>
	<li><b>user documentation -</b> information created to help users understand and use a product </li>
	<li><b>system documentation - </b>detailed information about a computer system including its architecture, design, data flow, and programming logic</li>
	<li><b>technical documentation -</b> the foundation information about the underlying architecture, materials, and process for interfacing with, or building on top of existing technology </li>
	
<h2>Intellectual property law </h2>
	<li><b>software license -</b> a legal instrument governming the use of redistrubtion of a software</li>
	<li><b>software disclaimer - </b>a software developer's formal notice to the user of their software that they are denying any and all liability for any damages caused as a result of using the software </li>
	
<br>
<b>Best defenses against software liability claims: </b>apply sound software engineering principles during the software's development, to use a level of care compatible with the software's application, and to produce and maintain records that validate these endeavors.
