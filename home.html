<h2><h2> History </h2>
<div class= "content">The Fourth Amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. Before the Revolutionary War, 
British tax collectors would break into and search any house they pleased without proper evidence of any wrongdoing. To protect the people’s rights 
to privacy, the Fourth Amendment was passed which granted people freedom from unreasonable searches by the government. However, this amendment does 
not provide protection from all searches, just those done by the government that are deemed unreasonable by the law. It is also stated that the 
government must have “probable cause” in order to conduct a search or make an arrest.  
				
<h2>What is Probable Cause?</h2>
<p> Probable cause is often defined as the reasonable suspicion or belief that a person is guilty of a crime based on valid evidence or 
observations. If a police officer has good reason to suspect someone of a crime, then they can make an arrest or search without a warrant. 
However, if the search is conducted with a lack of probable cause, all evidence found during that search cannot be used.
