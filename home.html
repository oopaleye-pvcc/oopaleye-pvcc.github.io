<h2><h2> History </h2>
<div class= "content">The Fourth Amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. Before the Revolutionary War, 
British tax collectors would break into and search any house they pleased without proper evidence of any wrongdoing. To protect the people’s rights 
to privacy, the Fourth Amendment was passed which granted people freedom from unreasonable searches by the government. However, this amendment does 
not provide protection from all searches, just those done by the government that are deemed unreasonable by the law. It is also stated that the 
government must have “probable cause” in order to conduct a search or make an arrest.  
				
<h2>What is Probable Cause?</h2>
<p> Probable cause is often defined as the reasonable suspicion or belief that a person is guilty of a crime based on valid evidence or 
observations. If a police officer has good reason to suspect someone of a crime, then they can make an arrest or search without a warrant. 
However, if the search is conducted with a lack of probable cause, all evidence found during that search cannot be used. 


 <h2>Court Cases</h2>
 <p>In MAPP V. OHIO, the Supreme Court ruled that illegally seized evidence could not be used in a state criminal trial. The case started on May 23, 
 1957 when Dollree Mapp, a 33 year old woman from Cleveland, was arrested for being in possession of obscene materials. Police had come to her home 
 under the suspicion the suspect of a recent bombing had been hiding away in her basement. When she denied them entry to her home, the officers forcefully
 let themselves in and proceeded to search her house without a warrant. While the police did not find the criminal they were after, they did stumble
 upon some inappropriate magazines and cartoons. Since being in possession of this kind of material was illegal in the state at the time, Dollree Mapp
 was arrested and put on trial.
 <p>During her case, Mapp’s lawyer, Alexander L. Kearns argued that Ohio’s obscenity law violated the right to privacy and that the officer’s methods of 
 obtaining the evidence was unconstitutional. The Ohio Supreme Court still affirmed their decision, however, and stated that illegally seized evidence
 could be entered in a criminal trial. Kearns then appealed  to the U.S. Supreme Court, and continued to argue his case. And at the invitation of the 
 court, Bernard A. Berkman, a Cleveland attorney representing the American Civil Liberties Union, submitted a brief. He questioned the constitutionality 
 of search and seizure laws in state courts, since federal courts disallowed the use of illegally obtained evidence. The Supreme court ended up 
 overturning the state court’s verdict, and agreed that the restrictions of Fourth Amendment that protect the people against unreasonable searches and
 seizures should apply to state governments.
