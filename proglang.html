<h2><b>Data Types:</h2>

<ul>
	<li> integer - represents a range of mathematical integers</li> 
	<li> float - represents a number that is not an integer</li>
	<li> string - represents a sequence of characters </li>
	<li> primitive data type - includes byt, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char</li>
	<li> data structure - an organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Python collection data structures:</h2>
<ul>
	<li> list - stores multiple items in a single variable, and is written with square brackets '[]'</li>
	<li> tuple - is ordered and unchangeable, and is written with round brackets '()'</li>
	<li> set - is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed, and is written with curly brackets '{}'</li>
	<li> dictionary - is ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates, and is written with curly brackets '{}' and has keys and values</li>
<br>
	<li> function - a block of code that only runs when it is called</li>
	<li> local variable - variable declared within a function and can only be used within that function</li>
	<li> global variable - vairable that is accessible throught the entire program</li>
	<li> source program - a human readable program that is written by a programmer</li>
	<li> object program - a program into which some other program is translated by an assembler or compiler </li>
